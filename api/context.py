"""
The class ChatManager manages all users and their conversations in the
form of a dictionary.

Each user has a ChatConversation instance, which may include multiple
previous conversations of the user (provided by the Google Gemini API).

The class ImageChatManager is rather simple, as the images in Gemini Pro
do not have a contextual environment. This class performs some tasks
such as obtaining photos to addresses and so on.
